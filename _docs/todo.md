# 🚀 SprintPilot Roadmap

SprintPilot is designed to bridge the gap between high-level strategic planning and realistic execution capacity. This roadmap outlines the trajectory from the current MVP to an enterprise-ready intelligence system.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Core Foundation (MVP)
- [x] **Domain Modeling**: Implementation of Mandays-based logic (Backend, Mobile, QA).
- [x] **Calculation Engine**: Logic for working days, capacity factors, and role-based utilization.
- [x] **Helicopter View**: Matrix UI for Sprints vs. Sprint Squads.
- [x] **Drag & Drop**: Basic story assignment from backlog to sprint cells.
- [x] **Detailed Gantt**: Auto-generated execution timeline based on role sequences.

---

## ✅ Phase 2: UX Refinement & Management
- [x] **User Story Management**: UI to add/edit stories with detailed role-based mandays estimation + Epic/Category tagging.
- [x] **Sprint Squad Configuration**: Ability to edit team size (members per role) for individual sprint-squad instances.
- [x] **Interactive Gantt**: Precise drag-and-drop bar scheduling.
- [x] **Conflict Indicators**: Real-time pulsing warnings for over-capacity.
- [x] **Data Seeding**: Extensive real-world data set for testing (100+ stories).

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Persistence & Planning Intelligence
- [x] **Backlog Search & Filtering**: High-value search and Epic filtering for large story sets.
- [x] **Conflict Dashboard**: Centralized panel to view all planning violations.
- [x] **Dependency Tracer**: Visual highlighting of critical paths in Helicopter View.
- [x] **Smart Auto-Sequencing**: One-click optimization of task handovers in Gantt view.

---

## ✅ Phase 4: Portfolio & AI Scaling
- [x] **AI Intelligence Hub**: Central interface for AI-driven planning actions.
- [x] **AI Health Audit**: Narrative explanation of planning risks using Gemini.
- [x] **"What-if" Sandbox Simulation**: Ability to branch plans and test scenarios.
- [x] **Multi-Project Management**: Support for multiple independent projects with scoped planning contexts.
- [x] **AI Requirements Ingestor**: Bulk sync user stories from documents/images with auto-estimation.

---

## 🏗 Phase 5: Enterprise Scaling - *In Progress*
- [x] **Global Dashboard**: Birds-eye view of resource utilization across ALL projects.
- [x] **Capacity Forecasting**: AI-driven prediction of team readiness for future projects based on historical load.
- [ ] **Backend Integration (Convex/Supabase)**: Real-time multi-user syncing.
- [ ] **Permission System**: Role-based access control (Admin, Planner, Viewer).

---

### 💡 Engineering Principles
- **Zero Silent Failures**: Every planning error must be visible.
- **Planner-Centric**: Every pixel must contribute to the decision "Can we commit to this?".
